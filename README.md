npm run start:dev
```

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=password
DATABASE_NAME=academic_platform

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# OpenAI Configuration (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
